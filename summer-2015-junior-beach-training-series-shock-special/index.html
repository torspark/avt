Players will both be divided into separate skill groups as well mixed together so the stronger players can work with the beginners to improve their own abilities as well as the beginners&#39;.</li> <li>If you already have a tournament partner, just let us know, and we&#39;ll pair you together for most drills.

The first part of each practice is dedicated to focusing on passing, setting, and hitting mechanics. We then use drills to reinforce those mechanics in more game-like situations.</p> <h4>Our training objectives are:</h4> <ol> <li>Make volleyball fun</li> <li>Prepare for the next upcoming tournament</li> <li>Improve teamwork and reinforce the importance of this</li> <li>Improve individual skill sets</li> </ol> <h4>We choose to coach this way because we believe:</h4> <ol> <li>If players aren&#39;t having fun, they&#39;re missing the point of the game.</li> <li>If players don&#39;t feel competitive, they might give up. Tournament wins help drive competitiveness.</li> <li>If players aren&#39;t good at being part of a team, they won&#39;t succeed in volleyball regardless of their mechanical prowess.</li> <li>Skills should improve from coaching and the prior three points due to it being fun and players realizing that their individual skill sets help in succeeding at volleyball.</li> </ol> <h2>About Your Coaches</h2> <p><img alt="Zack and Chris" src="/img/zack-and-chris-color-pop.jpg"/></p> <p>Zack Kweder and Chris Olds are the Head Coaches. We&#39;ve been playing and coaching together since 2012. We&#39;re actively traveling and competing on the NVL Beach Volleyball Tour. We&#39;re currently ranked 42nd and 51st on the national tour, and we&#39;re hoping to make this our best year yet.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve ever met Zack, you know he&#39;s all smiles. He has a lot to say and loves sharing his knowledge and helping players improve.</p> <p>Chris doesn&#39;t always talk as much as Zack, but when he does &mdash; it&#39;s usually worth listening to. :)</p> <p>We provide a good balance for each other, because we have complimentary styles, and we both strive to help our players develop their game in the best way possible. Just look at our coaching philosophy above to see what we believe.</p> <p>We coach both indoor and sand, but our hearts are definitely on the beach. The indoor coaching experience has enabled us to better help players transitioning from indoor to sand. We like helping indoor players figure out how to translate the skills they already have to make them successful on the beach.</p> <p>We also pull in a rotating series of third coaches from time to time. They provide a fresh perspective and new voices for the players to respond to.</p> <h2>Are You Ready to Train?</h2> <div class=row> <div class='medium-4 columns'> <em>Use Promo Code: SHOCK-5</em> <a class="button radius expand success" rel=nofollow href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/137905/592B5F9C/add_to_cart">Train Mondays</a> </div> <div class='medium-4 columns'> <em>Use Promo Code: SHOCK-10</em> <a class="button radius expand warning" rel=nofollow href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/packages/8582/49902B53/add_to_cart">Train Both Days</a> </div> <div class='medium-4 columns'> <em>Use Promo Code: SHOCK-5</em> <a class="button radius expand success" rel=nofollow href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/137906/B4583791/add_to_cart">Train Wednesdays</a> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class='small-12 columns'> <p><strong>Not quite yet?</strong> <a href="/newsletter/">Join our mailing list</a>, and we&#39;ll let you know about future camps and clinics.
